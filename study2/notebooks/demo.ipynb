    "## Goals of Study 2\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the study has two primary goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  To assess the impact of including surrounding textual **context** when generating chart interpretations on the retrieval performance of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.\n",
    "2.  To evaluate whether the performance impact observed in Study 1 holds true when using a smaller, more efficient Vision-Language Model (VLM).\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration showcases the workflow of creating separate vector store collections, embedding chart interpretations generated with and without context, adding them to their respective collections, and then querying the stores with example interpretations to obtain cosine similarity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models and Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Chart Interpretation Model:** [**InternVL3.5 1B**](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL3_5-1B-HF), a state-of-the-art, open-sourced 1B parameter VLM capable of running on consumer machines. \n",
    "*   **Text Embedding Model:** [**BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5**](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5), a top-performing and widely-used open-source model for generating high-quality text embeddings.\n",
    "*   **Vector Database:** **ChromaDB**, a modern, open-source vector store used to index and retrieve the generated chart interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answering Goal 1**\n",
    "    - The assessment will be based on cosine similarity scores produced by the retrieval pipeline. After aggregation, a statistical test will be conducted to determine whether the average scores differ significantly between the two conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answering Goal 2**\n",
    "    - The hypothesis is that chart interpretations generated with surrounding context will, on average, achieve higher cosine similarity scores with the queries. To avoid bias, these queries will be generated by the evaluator prior to producing the chart interpretations.\n"
