Beyond_the_Exponenti-with-image-refs,"The chart illustrates how subjective value decreases across temporal, probabilistic, and effort costs, reflecting the brain's tendency to discount delayed or less valuable information. This aligns with the thermodynamic metaphor of entropy accumulation, showing that higher costs (time, effort, or probability) lead to lower perceived value, highlighting the brain's energy-constrained nature in decision-making.","The chart shows that as the cost increases, subjective values decrease across three dimensions: temporal, probabilistic, and effort. Higher costs correlate with lower subjective values, suggesting a trade-off between cost and subjective judgment."
Oral_Language_Outcom-with-image-refs,"The chart illustrates the changes in language macrostructure outcomes across different phases and interventions for English and Spanish participants, highlighting improvements and fluctuations over time. In English, the total score generally decreases from baseline to maintenance phases, with notable increases during interventions, particularly in later phases. Spanish shows similar trends but with slightly more variability and minor fluctuations. The data indicates that while English participants show more consistent improvements, Spanish participants experience more variability, suggesting differences in linguistic proficiency or intervention effects. This suggests that targeted interventions may be more effective for English speakers, though Spanish participants' scores show greater inconsistency.","The chart shows participant scores over various interventions and maintenance periods using both English and Spanish. English participants generally perform better than Spanish participants across most interventions, with a notable improvement post-intervention 4 for English. Spanish scores show fluctuations but generally remain higher than English scores. Maintenance periods show slight improvements in both languages, with English scores slightly higher than Spanish.
