  "output_text": "The visualization compares two explainability strategies for neural networks: one that probes internal circuit components and one that attributes predictions directly to input features. On the left, a circuit query feeds into a component attribution method to highlight how particular pathways and units drive the computed output, using color-coded traces for distinct tasks. On the right, an input query with an attribution method produces a saliency map that pinpoints which raw inputs most influence the network’s decision. The central dashed link underscores that the component-focused technique can be adapted to multiple tasks, revealing task-specific subnetwork contributions that might go unnoticed through input saliency alone. Together, these approaches offer complementary insights—mapping mechanistic underpinnings and surface-level drivers—to guide more targeted model refinement and debugging.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
