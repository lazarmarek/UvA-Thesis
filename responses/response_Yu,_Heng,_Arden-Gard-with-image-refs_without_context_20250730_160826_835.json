  "output_text": "The chart shows how three teaching methods—prequestioning with feedback, prequestioning without feedback, and simply presenting learning objectives—impact students’ correct answers on questions they’d seen before versus entirely new ones. When students answered questions before studying and then received feedback, they achieved the highest scores on those practiced items but the lowest performance on new, untested questions. Prequestioning without feedback led to modest gains on practiced questions and better transfer to new ones, suggesting a broader but shallower grasp. Relying on learning objectives alone produced steady, middle-of-the-road results for both familiar and novel questions. This pattern indicates that feedback after pretesting sharpens recall of specific facts, while fewer cues or more general objectives encourage more flexible application to new problems.",
