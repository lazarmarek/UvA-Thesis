  "output_text": "The chart shows that employee productivity fluctuates over time but remains trapped within a “security zone” bounded by upper and lower limits. Within this zone, individuals fall into categories from low-engagement “wage criminals” and “accommodators” up to “middle workers,” while those breaching the top limit are labeled “careerists” and “high performers.” The dashed line represents average performance, yet the solid productivity line repeatedly spikes above and dips below it, illustrating how people self-regulate to stay in their comfort band. This pattern indicates that, absent deliberate challenges or incentives, most employees will plateau in moderate engagement levels. By raising stretch goals, offering targeted feedback, or reshaping rewards, managers can nudge more people toward sustained high performance.",
