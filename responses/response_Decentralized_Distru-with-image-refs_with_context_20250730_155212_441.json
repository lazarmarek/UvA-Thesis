  "output_text": "The chart reveals that consumers feel positively about credit cards across security, payment options, and fees, but express negative views toward cryptocurrencies on all three dimensions. Sentiment for cryptocurrencies dips most sharply around purchase costs and fees, signaling that pricing transparency and fee structure is a central concern. Negative perceptions also extend to the security and usability of cryptocurrency payments, suggesting users find these systems less intuitive or trustworthy. This pattern shows that perceived risk and complexity are significant barriers to broader cryptocurrency adoption. Companies looking to boost consumer confidence will need to simplify crypto payment processes, bolster security assurances, and clarify fee structures.",
