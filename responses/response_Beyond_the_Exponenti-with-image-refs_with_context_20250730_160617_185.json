  "output_text": "The chart shows that as any cost rises—be it waiting time, uncertainty, or required effort—the subjective value of a reward falls, but at different rates: delays erode value most slowly, uncertainty more steeply, and effort most sharply. This pattern suggests we are relatively patient with waiting but highly averse to expending effort or facing risk, consistent with a brain that balances reward against energy and information costs. By fitting all three as curved, hyperbolic declines, the visualization reveals a common thermodynamic principle: accumulating entropy or cognitive–physical load diminishes perceived value. Slow entropy buildup under time delays yields a gentle value drop, while the rapid energy demands of effort produce a steep decline. Altogether, these curves unify psychological discounting across domains into a single, energy-grounded framework.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
