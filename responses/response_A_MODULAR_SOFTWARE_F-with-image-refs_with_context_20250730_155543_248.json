  "output_text": "The chart reveals that equipping the agent with both an advanced policy and an advanced self-model drives it to peak performance almost instantly and sustain it, as shown by a flat maximal reward line. Self-confidence sharply rises to near certainty and remains there, while fatigue levels stabilize at a moderate value and slowly creep up, indicating manageable cognitive load. The self-modelâ€™s confidence and mode predictions converge to the real values in under fifty steps, sending prediction errors to zero and confirming highly accurate internal monitoring. After this convergence the agent locks into exploitation mode, highlighting that it has identified the best strategy and sees little gain in further exploration. This combination therefore yields a self-aware, stable controller that minimizes unnecessary switching and maintains consistent performance.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
