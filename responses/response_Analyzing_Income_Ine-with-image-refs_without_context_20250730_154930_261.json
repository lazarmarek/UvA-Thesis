  "output_text": "The visualization tracks a key indicator across Italy’s macroregions from 2010 to 2020, revealing that the North and Northwest consistently register the lowest levels (around 4–5 units) while the Mezzogiorno, Sud and especially the Islands remain at the highest end (peaking near 8 units) with more pronounced mid-decade spikes. The Centro region and the national average sit in between these extremes, rising steadily but without dramatic swings. All areas show a modest upward trend over the decade, suggesting a general national increase in this measure. Persistent gaps between North and South point to the need for focused strategies in the Mezzogiorno and Islands to bring their performance closer to Northern benchmarks.",
