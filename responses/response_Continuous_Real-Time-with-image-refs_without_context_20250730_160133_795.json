  "output_text": "The chart displays two box plots comparing prediction scores for non-click versus click events in subject RK01. Non-click scores are almost all piled below 0.05, while click scores sit much higher, with half of them falling between about 0.15 and 0.8 and a typical score near 0.78. This clear separation suggests that a cutoff around 0.2 would identify most clicks while excluding nearly all non-clicks. A handful of unusual readings—a click score near zero and a few non-click scores in the mid-range—reveal occasional misclassifications that could be fixed with more fine-tuning.",
