  "output_text": "The diagram illustrates a rigorous two‐stage screening process that winnowed an initial pool of 255 studies down to just 25 publications meeting the criteria for automated video analysis in top marketing journals. In the first stage, 211 papers were excluded for reasons such as being conceptual, non‐marketing, or lacking automated video analysis in relevant contexts. The second stage removed another 19 studies—primarily because they relied on manual coding or did not report sufficient methodological details—resulting in a final set of 25 empirical papers. This steep drop‐off highlights that fewer than 10% of identified studies actually employ automated video analytics, signaling a clear gap in the marketing literature. To build on these findings, future research should prioritize the development and transparent reporting of automated video‐analysis methods to strengthen empirical insights in marketing.",
