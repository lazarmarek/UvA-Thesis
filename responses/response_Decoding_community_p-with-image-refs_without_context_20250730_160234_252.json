  "output_text": "The chart reveals that local news coverage is heavily skewed toward a few headline spots, with Neuchâtel cited nearly 20,000 times and the Valais region and Switzerland itself each appearing around 16,000–18,000 times. Beyond these leaders, mentions plunge sharply, leaving smaller municipalities and border areas with only a fraction of media attention. This uneven distribution suggests a clear opportunity for news outlets to diversify their coverage and elevate underrepresented communities. Proactively featuring stories from these quieter locations could strengthen audience engagement and build a more balanced regional narrative.",
