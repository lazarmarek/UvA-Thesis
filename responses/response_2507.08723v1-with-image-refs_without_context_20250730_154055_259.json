  "output_text": "After a rapid build-out that raised the active detector count from about 500 to over 1,350 by early 2023, the array has held steady at full capacity ever since. Over the ensuing two years, the average single-particle signal has drifted upward by roughly 5%, and the PMT current has shown a similar small increase, suggesting mild ageing or gain shift. Meanwhile, the high-voltage supply has remained rock-solid within Â±1 V of its target, confirming excellent power stability. To keep measurement precision high, instituting a biannual gain calibration and routine current-leakage inspection is recommended to counteract the observed slow drifts.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\").
