  "output_text": "The chart outlines three dimensions to classify a medical language model: its level of task focus (broad versus specialized), its transparency (open versus closed design), and how itâ€™s deployed (hosted in-house or by an external partner). It then presents a blueprint for responsible deployment by centering on infrastructure readiness, transparent operations, explainability of outputs, and ongoing bias and fairness monitoring. Key actions include safeguarding patient privacy, navigating regulatory requirements, and verifying clinical accuracy before use. The visualization emphasizes building systems that can justify their recommendations, detect and correct bias, and measure fairness metrics to ensure equitable patient outcomes. Finally, it underlines the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and resource planning to support safe and trustworthy model adoption.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
