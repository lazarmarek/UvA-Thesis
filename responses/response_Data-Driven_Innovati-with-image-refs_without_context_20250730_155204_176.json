  "output_text": "The chart aligns Maslow’s hierarchy of human needs with the EU AI Act’s four-tier risk classification, showing that AI applications touching our most essential survival functions are banned outright. Systems that impinge on safety and legal rights—such as healthcare, infrastructure or immigration tools—are labeled high risk and subject to strict oversight. General-purpose models enabling chatbots, deepfakes or content creation fall into a limited-risk category with moderate transparency duties. Everyday utilities like video games, product recommendations or photo editing face minimal regulation since they operate at lower-impact levels. This mapping underscores how regulatory scrutiny intensifies as AI applications target more fundamental needs, guiding organizations to prioritize compliance efforts accordingly. It also reveals a gap around creative and self-actualizing AI functions, suggesting that emerging technologies in this space may require new regulatory attention.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
