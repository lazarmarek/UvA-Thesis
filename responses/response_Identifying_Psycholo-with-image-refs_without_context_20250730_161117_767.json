  "output_text": "Participants overwhelmingly rate their own Awareness and Future Orientation high, while giving relatively low scores to Threat Susceptibility and Habit, suggesting they feel informed and forward-thinking but arenâ€™t strongly driven by fear or routine. The right-hand plot reveals that stronger Awareness, positive Social Norms, greater Willingness, and a practical (Instrumental) Attitude are the most powerful drivers of the desired action, with confidence intervals entirely above zero. In contrast, negative feelings (Experiential Attitude) and fear-based perceptions (Threat Susceptibility) actually predict lower uptake. Locus of Control and Habit contribute positively but more modestly. These insights imply that interventions should boost clear information, emphasize practical benefits, and leverage social encouragement rather than rely on scare tactics.",
