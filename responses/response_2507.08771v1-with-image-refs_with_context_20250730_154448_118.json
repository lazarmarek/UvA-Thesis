  "output_text": "The chart shows that both BlockFFN variants steadily amplify their activation strengths from the first to the last layer, far surpassing the modest growth seen in the competing model. Removing RMSNorm in BlockFFN triggers the most dramatic rise, with activation magnitudes nearly tripling by the final layer, while keeping RMSNorm yields a smoother increase that still outperforms alternatives. In contrast, ReMoEâ€™s L1-based regularization keeps activations relatively low, suggesting a more uniform but weaker participation of its sub-networks. This demonstrates that tailoring the loss around the classification token inherently drives stronger, more concentrated learning in deeper layers, which can speed up convergence and improve inference efficiency. Applying a block-level normalization like RMSNorm offers a practical balance, tempering extreme activation growth for greater stability without losing the focused benefits of the classification-driven objective.",
