  "output_text": "The chart shows that in all scenarios, expanding renewable power delivers the vast majority of emission cuts by mid-century and beyond, reducing over 500 Mt CO2 per year by 2100. For moderate targets (S1 and S2), renewables supplemented by shifting from coal to gas achieve most reductions without needing carbon capture, while deeper cuts under S3 require adding nuclear capacity and small amounts of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) for both avoided emissions and removals. In the most ambitious pathway (S4), large-scale BECCS becomes the dominant contributor after renewables, pushing total reductions above baseline levels and resulting in net negative emissions by centuryâ€™s end. This implies that meeting stringent climate goals will depend not only on wind and solar but also on robust investment in biomass-based carbon removal. Policymakers should therefore pair aggressive clean power deployment with scalable BECCS infrastructure and consider targeted nuclear support if biomass availability or BECCS build-out faces limits.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\").
