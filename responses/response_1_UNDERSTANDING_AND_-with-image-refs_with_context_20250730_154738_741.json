  "output_text": "The chart compares weekday electricity use by hour for two family types before and after shifting consumption under a Time of Use tariff. The out-of-home family can move routine tasks into early-morning off-peak hours and noticeably reduce their peak-hour draw, yielding modest savings. By contrast, the stay-at-home family still records high mid-day and early-evening demand even after shifting, because many essential activities simply can’t be moved without disrupting care or work-from-home routines. This limited flexibility explains why they face a large bill penalty under the new tariff unless they make major compromises to their daily lives. The data highlights that a uniform Time of Use scheme may unfairly burden those with little capacity to shift energy‐intensive tasks, pointing to a need for tailored support or alternative pricing for such households.",
