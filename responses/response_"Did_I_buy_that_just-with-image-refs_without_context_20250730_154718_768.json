  "output_text": "The chart reveals that self-reported shares of organic products tend to be overstated more often than understated, as shown by the heavier right-hand tail beyond zero. Most deviations cluster within a 10-percentage-point window, indicating modest misreporting is common, but a small group exaggerates their organic purchases by 40+ points. This bias suggests that people believe they consume more organic food than they actually do, which could inflate survey estimates. Researchers and policymakers should adjust for this upward reporting bias or use complementary measures to get more accurate consumption data.",
