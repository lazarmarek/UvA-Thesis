  "output_text": "The chart tracks event‐level trigger counts over several days and shows a steady low‐level background punctuated by two dramatic spikes peaking at about 4,000 and 7,000 triggers. Each of these surge events aligns with periods of thunderstorm activity, indicating that storms drive a sudden and large increase in detected events. Outside of these bursts, trigger rates remain stable and modest, underlining how distinct the storm‐related enhancements are. Recognizing and filtering out these weather‐induced spikes can improve the reliability of background measurements and help isolate genuine signals of interest.",
