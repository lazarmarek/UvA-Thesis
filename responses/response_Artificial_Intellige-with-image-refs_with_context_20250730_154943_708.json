  "output_text": "The chart shows how integrating customer CRM records with AI-powered intent signals can automatically surface the most promising target accounts. Once these accounts are identified, the system dynamically serves tailored ads and tracks engagement to inform the sales teamâ€™s outreach. Captured performance metrics are then funneled back into the CRM to sharpen future targeting and messaging. This continuous feedback cycle not only accelerates campaign optimization but also aligns marketing and sales around data-driven insights. Companies that adopt this loop can minimize wasted spend, boost conversion rates, and quickly adapt to shifting account behaviors.",
