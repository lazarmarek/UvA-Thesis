  "output_text": "The chart reveals that participants’ self-estimates of their organic product share spanned a wide range, from underestimations of about 35 percentage points to overestimations exceeding 60 points, with most errors clustering within ±20 points. A noticeable skew toward positive values shows that shoppers more often believe they buy a higher share of organic items than they actually do. Nearly half of the sample misjudged their organic share by more than 10 percentage points, highlighting that simple recall questions may substantially misrepresent true behavior. These findings suggest that researchers and retailers should pair self-reported organic purchase data with objective basket or transaction records to obtain a more accurate picture of consumer behavior.",
