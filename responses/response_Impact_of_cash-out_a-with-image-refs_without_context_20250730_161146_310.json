  "output_text": "The chart examines whether giving bettors an early cash-out option changes how conservative or risky their wagers are, comparing those with low versus high problem-gambling severity. In both groups, the typical bet’s implied win probability – a proxy for risk level – sits at virtually the same point whether cash-out is offered or not, and each group shows a similarly wide range of bet risk. Statistical tests show these tiny shifts aren’t meaningful, meaning cash-out availability doesn’t systematically push bettors toward safer or bolder plays. In practical terms, simply adding a cash-out feature doesn’t appear to alter betting behavior, even among individuals with more severe gambling issues.",
