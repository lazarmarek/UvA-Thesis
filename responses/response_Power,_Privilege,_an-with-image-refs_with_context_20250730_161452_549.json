  "output_text": "The chart lays out three interconnected approaches—alignment, awareness, and analysis—that guide departments from lofty equity goals to concrete practices by aligning policies, fostering an inclusive culture, and setting up conditions for change. Alignment ensures ideals, norms, and organizational policies reinforce each other, promising accountability and justice while warning of risks like unequal burdens on underrepresented faculty and skewed participation. Awareness cultivates an environment that values diverse cultural styles and voices, yet requires active interruption of hidden biases and resistance to shifting power. Analysis establishes clear commitments, reward structures, and measurable goals to sustain transformation, even as it anticipates pushback against losing entrenched privileges. Together, these pillars generate new equity-driven norms, a culture that celebrates variation, and a critically engaged community equipped for ongoing change.",
