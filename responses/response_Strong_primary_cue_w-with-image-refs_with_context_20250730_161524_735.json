  "output_text": "The chart reveals that native English listeners with strong dimension-selective attention exhibit a markedly steeper rise in choosing “study MUSIC” as duration increases, compared with listeners who have poorer selective attention. This steeper response function shows that high-attention individuals rely more heavily on the primary prosodic cue—duration—when identifying phrase boundaries. In contrast, the low-attention group’s shallower slope reflects less consistent weighting of duration differences. These divergent profiles underscore that dimension-selective attention ability directly shapes the development of effective perceptual strategies for prosodic feature weighting. Together, the data suggest that enhancing selective attention could help listeners tune into crucial acoustic cues more reliably.",
