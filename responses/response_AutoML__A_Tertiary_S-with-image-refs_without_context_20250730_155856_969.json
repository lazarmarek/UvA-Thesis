  "output_text": "The chart outlines a multi-stage filtering process that starts with 100 search hits plus six seed papers and narrows them down to 32 documents for detailed analysis. An initial screening picks 33 candidates, then reference-driven snowballing adds 34 more, showing that almost half of the final set emerges from manual follow-up rather than automated queries alone. Rigorous criteria then reduce 67 candidates to 32 included studies, highlighting a deliberate balance between breadth and focus. This combination of wide-reaching database searches and targeted reference tracking ensures comprehensive discovery without diluting quality.",
