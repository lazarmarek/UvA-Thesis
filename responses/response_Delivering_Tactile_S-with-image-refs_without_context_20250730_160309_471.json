  "output_text": "The chart reveals that light signals actually begin about 30 ms after the command, sound signals around 40 ms, and vibration signals around 80 ms, with each modality showing a tight cluster of trials around those means. When these are nominally presented together, sound ends up roughly 10 ms behind light and vibration nearly 50 ms behind on average. Because the distributions are narrow, these offsets are highly reliable and will consistently introduce perceivable asynchronies. Ignoring them can lead to unintended timing errors in experiments or multimedia experiences. To achieve true synchrony, sound should be launched about 10 ms earlier and vibration about 50 ms earlier relative to light.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
