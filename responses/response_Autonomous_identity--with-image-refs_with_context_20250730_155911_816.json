  "output_text": "The diagram presents a zero-trust flow where every access request—whether from a user, device, or application—is routed through layered policy checks (policy-based, role-based, and attribute-based) to generate a normalized risk score. That score is continuously compared against a predefined threshold, automatically allowing, denying, or triggering additional authentication steps as needed. Continuous visibility and analytics span the entire sequence, catching subtle shifts in behavior before any sensitive data, services, or assets are exposed. By adapting decisions in real time based on these normalized metrics and policy rules, organizations can isolate anomalous identities and minimize blind spots. This dynamic, risk-driven approach ensures no identity is implicitly trusted and keeps critical resources under tight control.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
