  "output_text": "The chart shows that in the initial, unpaid blocks participants’ self‐reported predictions cluster modestly above chance (around 6–8 correct out of 12) with very similar profiles under both high‐loss and low‐loss framings. The moment any payment scheme kicks in—whether via the BDM mechanism or an auction format—nearly everyone reports the maximum of 12 correct, collapsing all meaningful variation. That surge to perfect scores under incentive implies strong inflation of self‐reports rather than genuine performance gains. Moreover, the virtually identical spike at 12 across all paid blocks suggests that neither payment design deters overstatement. Taken together, these patterns warn that relying on participants’ payment‐linked declarations can produce highly misleading measures of actual ability.",
