  "output_text": "The chart illustrates a steep decline in retake rates once first‐attempt scores exceed 80%: over 80% of students scoring below this mark choose to retake, compared with about 20% of those above it. This pattern indicates that learners impose an informal 80% mastery threshold when deciding whether to revisit a test. Educators can leverage this natural decision point by offering targeted review resources or prompts for students hovering near that boundary to encourage deeper engagement. Aligning feedback and retake opportunities with this threshold could boost overall mastery while respecting the confidence of higher‐scoring students.",
