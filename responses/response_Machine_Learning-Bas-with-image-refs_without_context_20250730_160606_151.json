  "output_text": "The chart shows that the Random Forest model relies most heavily on channel EEG_159, with an importance score around 0.02, making it roughly twice as influential as the lowest-ranked channel in this top ten. Channels EEG_44 and EEG_158 also contribute significantly, together forming the modelâ€™s core decision-making signals. In contrast, channels like EEG_12, EEG_71, and EEG_127 have much smaller importances and could be candidates for removal or simplified treatment. Prioritizing the high-impact electrodes (159, 44, 158) can streamline feature selection, reduce dimensionality, and maintain or even boost predictive accuracy. Focusing analysis and signal processing efforts on these key channels will help optimize both performance and interpretability.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
