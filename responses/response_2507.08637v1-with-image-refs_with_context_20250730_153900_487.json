  "output_text": "The chart divides the modelâ€™s workflow into three color-coded stages: initial data splitting, wavelet-based filtering, and an efficient attention module. In the filtering stage, each data stream is broken down into broad and fine-grained details, then a learned gating system removes noisy fine details while emphasizing important broad patterns. These cleaned signals are reconstructed and passed through a fast projection step that approximates traditional attention calculations at a fraction of the computational cost. By adaptively selecting which detail levels to keep, the system concentrates on the most relevant sequence features, improving its ability to handle long-range dependencies and ignore background noise. Overall, the diagram demonstrates how combining multi-scale filtering with efficient approximation techniques yields a powerful, resource-friendly attention mechanism.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
