  "output_text": "The chart traces maintenance from a purely reactive “fix-it-when-it-breaks” stance in the mid-1930s through a mid-century phase of scheduled shutdowns powered by bulky mainframes, to today’s predictive, reliability-centered model.  As computers shrank and grew more powerful, organizations moved from simply planning routine overhauls to monitoring equipment health in real time and analyzing failure modes.  By embedding reliability and maintainability into the original design and leveraging intelligent systems alongside cross-functional teams, businesses can anticipate issues before they occur.  This progression shows that investing in condition monitoring and design-for-reliability not only cuts unplanned downtime but also optimizes maintenance resources and drives overall operational efficiency.",
