  "output_text": "The chart compares average sentiment toward credit cards and cryptocurrencies across security & usability, payment options, and purchase & fees. Credit cards receive uniformly positive feedback, peaking on security & usability and remaining moderately strong on payment options and fees. In contrast, cryptocurrencies earn negative scores in every category, with the biggest downside rooted in purchase fees and complexity. The most pronounced divergence occurs around purchase & fees, highlighting cost concerns and purchase complexity as central hurdles for crypto adoption. To close this gap, cryptocurrency services should focus on clearer pricing models and a smoother checkout experience to earn more positive sentiment.",
