  "output_text": "The chart compares peak GPU memory use of three training approaches—AdamW, GreedyLore without an extra feature (EF), and GreedyLore with EF—across four LLaMA model sizes. For the smallest 60 M–parameter model, GreedyLore without EF uses slightly less memory than AdamW, while adding EF nudges it just above the baseline. As models grow to 350 M and 1 B parameters, both GreedyLore variants begin to exceed AdamW’s footprint, with the EF-enabled version showing the largest overhead. This pattern highlights that the extra feature introduces a moderate but compounding memory cost at scale. In practice, teams working with very large models should plan for this additional GPU memory requirement or consider sticking with the lighter-weight version when resources are limited.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
