  "output_text": "The chart outlines a four‐stage workflow that transforms raw text into a rigorously validated formal dataset. First, data is gathered from natural‐language corpora, ontologies, and web resources, then filtered and synthesized to create a clean input set. Next, a fine‐tuned semantic model translates each sentence into precise declarations and facts, which are passed through automated syntax parsers and formal compilers to catch formatting or logical errors. Finally, human experts and advanced language models perform a last semantic review, ensuring only accurate, well‐formed knowledge enters the final repository. This layered process of automated checks and expert validation offers a practical blueprint for building high‐integrity knowledge bases.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
