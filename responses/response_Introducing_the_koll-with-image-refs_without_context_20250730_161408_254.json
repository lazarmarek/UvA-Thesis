  "output_text": "The chart reveals two tightly clustered fixation points in each condition, one near the left and one near the right of the display, connected by a long horizontal saccade. These clusters—highlighted by the colored circles—overlap almost perfectly across the 25°, 30° and 50° conditions, indicating that the large saccade consistently lands at the same positions regardless of angle. The dense clouds of small dots after the right cluster show a similar upward drift or exploratory scanning pattern in all three cases. This consistency suggests that the main saccade targeting is robust to changes in the intermediate viewing angle. Researchers can therefore treat initial and secondary fixation locations as stable anchors even when experimental angles vary.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
