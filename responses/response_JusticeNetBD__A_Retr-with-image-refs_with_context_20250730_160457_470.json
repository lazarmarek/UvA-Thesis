  "output_text": "The chart shows that the grounded retrieval model tailored to Bangladeshi statutes roughly doubles lexical overlap scores (ROUGE-L) compared to general-purpose LLMs, rising to about 0.46 versus 0.21–0.24 for DeepSeek V3, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and ChatGPT-4o. It also edges out those models on semantic similarity (BERTScore), reaching around 0.90 versus 0.85–0.86, which means precise statutory citations boost both factual accuracy and linguistic fluency. This gap makes it clear that injecting exact legal text into prompts effectively prevents hallucinations and ensures claims can be traced back to authoritative sources. Anyone building high-stakes legal advice tools should therefore integrate domain-specific retrieval of statutes to deliver more accurate, transparent, and reliable outputs.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
