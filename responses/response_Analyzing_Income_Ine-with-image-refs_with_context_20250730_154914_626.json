  "output_text": "The visualization tracks the widening gap between the richest and poorest households across Italy’s macro-regions from 2004 to 2020. Northern areas have contained this gap with only slight 4–6% increases, while the Centre saw a more pronounced rise of about 8%. In stark contrast, the Mezzogiorno—particularly the South—jumped by over 12% and the Islands climbed around 6%, pushing their inequality well above the national trend. Italy overall experienced a moderate 5% uptick, nested between these regional extremes. These diverging paths underscore deep structural challenges in the South and suggest that targeted investments in infrastructure, education, and job creation will be critical to narrowing this persistent divide.",
