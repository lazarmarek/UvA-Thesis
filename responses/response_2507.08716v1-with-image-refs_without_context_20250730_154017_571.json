  "output_text": "The chart illustrates how an electromagnetic wave striking a boundary between two media splits into a reflected beam and a transmitted beam with angles set by the change in material. It contrasts two polarization states: in the TE case the electric field oscillates perpendicular to the plane of incidence, while in the TM case the magnetic field does. Because each polarization enforces different matching conditions on the fields at the interface, they yield different reflection and transmission strengths. Notably, the TM arrangement can eliminate reflection entirely at a specific incidence angle (the Brewster angle), a principle behind anti-glare coatings and polarized sunglasses. The inclusion of the two media’s impedances (η₁ and η₂) highlights how material properties tune this balance of reflected versus transmitted energy.",
