  "output_text": "The chart compares three methods for filtering data by showing how many valid observations they mistakenly discard versus how many problematic ones they successfully catch. When set to only reject about 0.1% of good data, the cascade and muon approaches still flag just over half of the bad observations, while the deepcore approach captures a bit less. If we allow up to a 10% false-reject rate, all three rise to around 90% detection of bad data, and they converge toward 100% detection only when false rejects also approach 100%. This highlights that modest increases in the allowed discard rate can dramatically improve problem detection. For cases where preserving valid data is paramount, the cascade or muon methods offer the most effective balance.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\").
