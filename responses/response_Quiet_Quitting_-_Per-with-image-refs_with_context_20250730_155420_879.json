  "output_text": "The visualization maps an individual’s productivity over time against defined upper and lower performance thresholds, illustrating a “safety zone” where many employees settle into doing the minimum required. Fluctuations within that zone represent “middle workers” and “accommodators” who remain engaged enough to meet expectations but avoid extra effort, while fewer consistently push above the upper limit as “high performers” or “careerists,” and some dip below the lower limit as “wage criminals.” This pattern shows that a large share of the workforce quietly quits by staying within a comfort zone rather than striving for higher outcomes, risking stagnation in engagement and productivity. Organizations can use these insights to tailor incentives, feedback and recognition strategies that nudge more employees out of the safety zone toward higher engagement. Tracking real performance against clear thresholds helps leaders identify who needs support, challenge, or reward to foster a more dynamic and committed workforce.",
