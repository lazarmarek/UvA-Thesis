  "output_text": "The chart shows that the perceived worth of a reward declines as its associated cost in time, uncertainty, or effort increases. The top curve (temporal) tells us that people devalue delayed rewards but still hold onto a fair amount of their initial appeal. The middle curve (probabilistic) reveals that introducing uncertainty causes a steeper drop in perceived value, so gambles feel less attractive than simply waiting. The bottom curve (effort) makes it clear that even modest work requirements lead to the sharpest loss of appeal, as people tend to avoid tasks that demand physical or mental exertion. This suggests that reducing effort barriers will boost motivation more effectively than minimizing delays or uncertainty.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
