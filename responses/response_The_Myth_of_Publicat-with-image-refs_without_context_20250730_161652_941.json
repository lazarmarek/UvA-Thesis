  "output_text": "The chart reveals that studies in parapsychology report positive outcomes far less often—about one third of the time—than three major surveys of mainstream psychology, which range from roughly two-thirds to nearly all positive findings. This stark contrast suggests that mainstream psychology literature is heavily skewed toward publishing positive results. In contrast, parapsychology’s lower positive rate might reflect either a more balanced approach to reporting or a genuine scarcity of reproducible effects. Bridging this gap will require both fields to register research plans in advance, encourage the publication of null findings, and invest in replication efforts. By normalizing transparent reporting, researchers can build a more trustworthy evidence base across disciplines.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
