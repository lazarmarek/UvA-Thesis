  "output_text": "The chart depicts an end-to-end workflow for building a flood-image dataset by aggregating raw visuals from Kaggle repositories, other curated sources, and social media (including frames extracted from videos). In a centralized labeling environment, each image is tagged with one of fifteen flood-relevant classes—ranging from flooded areas, vehicles, destroyed trees and vegetation to debris, people, pets, rivers, rain and other meteorological features—before undergoing systematic quality checks. Once verified, the annotated images pass through digitization and feature-extraction steps that convert them into structured, model-ready data. By combining diverse inputs with rigorous annotation and validation, this pipeline ensures a rich and reliable foundation for training flood-detection and damage-assessment models.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
