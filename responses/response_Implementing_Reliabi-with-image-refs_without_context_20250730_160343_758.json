  "output_text": "The chart outlines how maintenance approaches have transformed alongside computing breakthroughs. In the 1940s, teams only fixed equipment after it broke, but by the 1960s they scheduled shutdowns and used planning systems despite relying on large, slow computers. From the 1980s onward, organizations adopted continuous equipment health monitoring, careful analysis of potential failure points, and designs that prioritized reliability, all enabled by smaller, faster computers and collaborative tools. This progression highlights how moving from reactive repairs to data-driven maintenance strategies can drastically improve performance. Today, businesses can boost uptime and cut costs by embracing real-time analytics, design-for-reliability principles and cross-functional teamwork.",
