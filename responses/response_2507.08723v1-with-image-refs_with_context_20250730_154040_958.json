  "output_text": "The chart tracks four performance metrics—signal charge per particle, PMT supply voltage, detector current, and number of active units—across an 18-month period, showing a rapid deployment phase that levels off by mid-2023. Once at full scale, signal readings stay within a 5% band, voltage holds to better than 1% of its set-point, and current fluctuates only a few microamps, illustrating the effectiveness of automatic high-voltage regulation and cross-calibration. Small, regular oscillations in both signal charge and current line up with seasonal temperature shifts, confirming an environmental influence on detector gain. Introducing finer thermal compensation or adaptive gain control would help tighten these residual variations and boost long-term stability.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
