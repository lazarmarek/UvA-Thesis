  "output_text": "The chart presents a clear model for building fairness into business and legal operations, anchored by overarching legal and operational requirements. It distinguishes four interlinked fairness types—fair resource allocation, transparent information sharing, consistent and adaptable procedures, and respectful interpersonal treatment—that together shape people’s sense of justice. Distributive fairness balances individual needs with equal treatment, informational fairness relies on privacy protections and truthful disclosures, procedural fairness is ensured by rules like timeliness, consistency, adjustability, and accuracy, and interpersonal fairness is grounded in respect. Channels for participation and voice, including representativeness and decision control, reinforce procedural trust and legitimacy. Overall, this framework provides actionable steps to design systems that not only meet legal standards but also resonate with users’ expectations for fairness and respect.",
