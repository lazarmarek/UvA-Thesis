  "output_text": "The diagram lays out a modular workflow that ties every agent action to a verifiable identity before execution, ensuring that requests only proceed when both user and AI are cryptographically authenticated. By running sensitive logic inside a secure enclave and immediately checking outcomes against an ethical policy layer, the process embeds real-time compliance checks that can halt or escalate ambiguous decisions. Automated logging to a public ledger creates an immutable audit trail, feeding back into legacy systems and reinforcing accountability without interrupting operational flow. The built-in escalation checkpoint ensures any policy deviations trigger human review, striking a balance between autonomy and oversight that any organization can adopt to manage AI risk. This end-to-end lifecycle underscores how layered governance—from identity to execution, policy to audit, and interoperability—translates into transparent, traceable, and ethically aligned decision-making.",
