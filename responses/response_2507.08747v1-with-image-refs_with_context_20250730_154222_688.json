  "output_text": "The chart illustrates the number of basic detector triggers recorded over several days, with two pronounced peaks that coincide with periods of thunderstorm activity. Outside these storm windows, the trigger rate stays low and steady, but during lightning events it soars by more than an order of magnitude, overwhelming the normal data flow. These surges are caused by electrical noise from lightning, which makes neighboring stations fire in unison as if they saw real air showers. The resulting backlog of spurious events clogs the communication pipeline, delaying genuine cosmic-ray data requests and dropping the purity of collected events. Introducing real-time noise filtering or flagging during storms would help prioritize valid signals and maintain high detector uptime.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
