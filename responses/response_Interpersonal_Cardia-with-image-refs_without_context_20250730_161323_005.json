  "output_text": "The chart tracks how long it takes between heartbeats for each person, showing that one individual’s rhythm stays steadier and slower while the other’s speeds up and slows down more dramatically. Despite these differences, their rhythms tend to rise and fall in tandem. A correlation analysis reveals that when one person’s heartbeat interval shifts, a similar change often appears in the other’s signal a few moments later. This time-shifted matching suggests the pair is physiologically attuned during their interaction. Monitoring such real-time heart-rhythm alignment could offer a practical way to assess and strengthen supportive connections.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
