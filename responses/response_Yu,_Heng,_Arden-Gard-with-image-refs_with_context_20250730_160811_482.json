  "output_text": "The chart visualizes how three study conditions affect accuracy on practiced (tested) versus unpracticed (untested) questions. In the feedback condition, median accuracy on practiced items climbs to about 60% and individual scores are tightly clustered, outperforming both the no-feedback and control groups. By contrast, for unpracticed items the feedback group yields the lowest median accuracy, while no-feedback and control participants maintain similar, higher performance. Prequestioning without feedback fails to boost accuracy on practiced questions and shows no detriment on unpracticed ones. Together, these patterns reveal a clear interaction: feedback enhances retention of specifically probed content but does not generalize— and may even hamper—performance on new material.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
