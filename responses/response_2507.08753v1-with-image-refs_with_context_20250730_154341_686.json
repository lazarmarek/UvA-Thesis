  "output_text": "The chart compares how four different galactic emission models predict the per-flavor neutrino flux across a wide energy range. At a few TeV up to tens of TeV, all models cluster around similar flux levels, but above ~100 TeV they diverge sharply: the Fermi π⁰ curve drops off steeply, the CRINGE and KRA5 templates sit in the middle, and the KRA50 scenario maintains a pronounced high-energy tail extending toward the PeV scale. This spread means that measurements in the highest-energy bins will be most sensitive to telling these models apart. Focusing observational efforts above 100 TeV will therefore be key to confirming or ruling out the presence of extra high-energy neutrinos predicted by the more optimistic templates.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\").
