  "output_text": "The chart tracks how a standardized Hₜ score relates to the percentage-point rise in collision probability. When Hₜ is below or near its average (negative to zero values), the model shows almost no increase in collision chance and the shaded confidence band stays narrow, indicating stable, low risk. Once Hₜ climbs above average, the estimated collision probability accelerates sharply—nearly reaching a 20-point jump at one standard deviation above—and the confidence interval widens, reflecting greater uncertainty in high-stress conditions. This suggests that keeping Hₜ within normal bounds can effectively limit collision risk, while letting it rise leads to disproportionately larger and less predictable dangers.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
