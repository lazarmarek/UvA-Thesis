  "output_text": "The chart tracks each participant’s total retelling scores in English and Spanish across baseline, intervention, and maintenance phases. Participant 1’s English scores rose well above baseline during the intervention and stayed high in maintenance, while Spanish scores remained flat, showing that the intervention most strongly boosted their weaker language. Participant 2’s scores in both languages fluctuated around baseline with no clear upward trend, indicating minimal intervention impact. Participant 3 experienced a marked increase in Spanish scores during intervention but less consistency afterward, and only modest gains in English. These patterns suggest that focused storytelling practice can effectively strengthen narrative retelling when initial skills are low, but that ongoing reinforcement may be needed to sustain and generalize improvements.",
