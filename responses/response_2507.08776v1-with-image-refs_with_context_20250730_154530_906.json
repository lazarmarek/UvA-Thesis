  "output_text": "The chart shows that combining latent K-means clustering with neural condensation delivers the highest rendering fidelity per data token, reaching nearly 30 dB PSNR, 0.10 LPIPS, and 0.92 SSIM at the 4096-token setting. Removing K-means leads to the largest drop in quality (about 0.5â€“1 dB PSNR) and higher perceptual error, while dropping the condenser also hurts fidelity, though to a smaller extent. Beyond roughly 1024 tokens, PSNR gains taper off, indicating that most scene detail can be captured with a moderate token budget. Rendering speed falls smoothly from around 110 FPS at 128 tokens to about 55 FPS at 4096 tokens, and theoretical cost rises linearly from ~12 GFLOPs to ~72 GFLOPs, illustrating a clear trade-off between quality and performance. These results confirm that each component is essential for building a compact, high-quality scene representation that can be tuned on-the-fly without retraining.",
