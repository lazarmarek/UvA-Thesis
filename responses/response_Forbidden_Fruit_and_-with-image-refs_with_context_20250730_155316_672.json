  "output_text": "The chart shows that migrants’ sense of prohibition at home builds a strong symbolic attraction to a forbidden behavior, making first-time use almost inevitable once they arrive in a permissive setting. This initial surge in use then interacts with post-migration stress and coping efforts, driving consumption into a compulsive escalation. By framing the journey in two stages—initial forbidden‐fruit initiation and later rebound escalation—the model highlights how lifting constraints without support can inadvertently trigger deepening addiction. Effective interventions should combine early awareness about the risks of sudden freedom with accessible stress-management and coping resources. Addressing both the lure of the forbidden and the need for healthy coping can help prevent the slide from experimentation to compulsive use.",
