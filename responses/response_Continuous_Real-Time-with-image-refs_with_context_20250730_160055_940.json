  "output_text": "The box plots compare how often the model assigns high click-probability scores to actual fist-clench gestures versus all other hand movements for one participant. Genuine clicks have a median probability around 0.75 with most values above 0.6, while non-click gestures stay clustered near zero, showing very few false positives. This clear gap demonstrates that the network can reliably distinguish click from non-click gestures. Because the click probabilities still vary across trials, setting a tailored threshold for each subject helps minimize both missed clicks and false alarms. Overall, these results confirm that the multilayer perceptron achieves strong, actionable click-decoding performance.",
