  "output_text": "The chart aligns the EU’s four AI risk categories with Maslow’s hierarchy of human needs, showing that any AI infringing on basic physiological needs (like food, shelter or health) is outright prohibited. Systems that underpin safety and security—such as public services, education or justice—are marked high risk and must follow strict risk-management, data-governance and human-oversight requirements. AI tools focused on social interaction and esteem—think chatbots or content generators—fall into a limited-risk zone, so developers need clear documentation, copyright compliance and user transparency. Finally, creative and self-development applications (video games, photo editors, recommendation engines) sit in the minimal-risk category, allowing innovators to move forward with only light regulatory requirements.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
