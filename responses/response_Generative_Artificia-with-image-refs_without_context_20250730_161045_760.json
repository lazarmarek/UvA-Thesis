  "output_text": "The chart portrays that heavy reliance on generative AI appears across three areas: persistent thoughts about using it, real-life downsides like work disruption, and emotional distress when it’s unavailable. Each feature—such as urges to use AI without real need, trouble finishing responsibilities, or feeling irritable when access is cut off—is strongly connected to its area, with most linkages indicating very close relationships. The exceptionally high connections among these three areas suggest they combine into a single pattern of dependency on generative AI. This means efforts to curb problematic use should simultaneously address obsessive focus on AI, mitigate its negative impact on productivity and confidence, and alleviate withdrawal discomfort when access is limited. By taking this holistic approach, users can maintain a healthier, more balanced engagement with AI tools.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
