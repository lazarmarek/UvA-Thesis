  "output_text": "The chart shows how an initial pool of 255 articles from Web of Science was narrowed down to just 25 studies, an exclusion rate of over 90%. Most papers were culled during title and abstract screening because they didnâ€™t examine video content for marketing purposes. Further full-text review removed studies relying on manual coding or lacking clear methodological details. This steep drop-off reveals a significant gap in rigorously designed, data-driven video marketing research. Enhancing methodological clarity and broadening the focus could help build a stronger foundation in this emerging field.",
