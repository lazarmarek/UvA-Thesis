  "output_text": "The chart shows that more than half of respondents believe their content was removed to silence their opinion, while only about 15% acknowledge they may have violated rules and roughly 13% see political motives. Very few point to bias against them or language barriers as the cause. This gap highlights a trust issue in how moderation decisions are perceived. By providing clearer, case-specific explanations for removals and simplifying policy language, the platform can reduce confusion and strengthen user confidence in its processes.",
