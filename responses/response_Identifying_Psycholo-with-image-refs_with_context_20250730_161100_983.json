  "output_text": "The chart shows that people who keep their loud-music exposure within safe limits consistently report stronger self-regulation skills (capacity), greater anticipation of regret if they listen unsafely, more practical (“instrumental”) attitudes toward protecting their hearing, a future-focused outlook, higher awareness of risks, and more willingness to act than those who exceed 2.5 hours per week. On the right, the size of these associations (Cohen’s d) is largest for capacity and anticipated regret, indicating these are the most powerful levers for encouraging safe listening. In contrast, enjoying the thrill of loud music (experiential attitude) is strongly linked to unsafe habits, and perceiving oneself as threatened by hearing loss shows a moderate negative relationship with safe behavior. Social norms and locus of control barely move the needle, suggesting that simply telling people “everyone else is doing it” or “you’re in control” won’t shift habits much. Focusing on building self-regulatory skills, highlighting potential regret, and framing hearing protection as a practical, future-oriented choice should therefore drive the greatest improvements in safe listening.",
