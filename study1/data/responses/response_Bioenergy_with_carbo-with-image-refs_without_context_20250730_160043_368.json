  "output_text": "The chart shows that all four pathways rely heavily on a rapid build-out of wind and solar power, yet the two least ambitious cases only bend emissions downward temporarily before they creep back up by century’s end. In contrast, the deeper-cutting scenarios layer in growing amounts of bioenergy coupled with carbon capture, driving net CO₂ flows below zero after mid-century. Small contributions from new nuclear plants and cleaner industrial processes help a bit, but by themselves they fall short of delivering a true turnaround. The clear takeaway is that while renewables are indispensable for cutting emissions, achieving—and sustaining—net-negative CO₂ will also require large-scale carbon removal technologies.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
