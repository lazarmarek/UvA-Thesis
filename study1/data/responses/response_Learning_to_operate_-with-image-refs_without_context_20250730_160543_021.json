  "output_text": "The chart segments a single button-press task into five clear stages—Reach, Grasp, Transport, Release, and Button reach—by plotting hand‐aperture (red), closing/opening velocity (green), and button‐press events (blue) over time. During Reach the hand stays wide open with almost zero velocity, then in Grasp a steep drop in aperture and a sharp negative velocity peak mark the closing action. The Transport phase holds the gripper fully closed until the Release trigger produces a rapid positive velocity spike and reopening of the hand. Finally, the Button reach phase shows the hand back at its open position just before a brief button‐press pulse closes the sequence. Plotted this way, the data provide a reliable fingerprint for automatically identifying each subtask in a pick-and-press motion.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
