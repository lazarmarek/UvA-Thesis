  "output_text": "The chart illustrates how rigid legal and operational demands around shift scheduling filter through four pillars of workplace justice—distributive, procedural, informational and interpersonal—and ultimately curb healthcare workers’ sense of fairness. Under distributive fairness, mandatory rest requirements and limited rotation options upset the balance between individual need and equal treatment, while staffing shortages shrink opportunities for meaningful participation and decision control. Procedural rules like adjustability, timeliness and consistency break down when flexibility is sacrificed to comply with regulations, and limited disclosure or one-way communications further damage informational fairness. Respectful interpersonal interactions also suffer when workers feel constrained by unyielding legal mandates. To restore fairness perceptions, organizations should focus on enhancing schedule flexibility, clear two-way communications and granting more decision-making autonomy within the bounds of necessary legal safeguards.",
