  "output_text": "The chart shows how the proportion of participants choosing to study music rises as the allotted duration increases, with two different conditions indicated by red and gray lines. In both cases, the share climbs from just under 50% at the shortest interval to just over 55% at the longest, revealing that giving people more time consistently encourages more music study. The red condition maintains a higher uptake than the gray at every duration, suggesting itâ€™s more effective at promoting engagement. Even though the error bars overlap slightly at lower durations, the clear upward trend and persistent gap between lines indicate that both longer exposure and the factors represented by the red line reliably boost the likelihood of studying music.",
