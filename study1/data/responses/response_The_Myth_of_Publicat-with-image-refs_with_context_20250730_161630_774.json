  "output_text": "The chart shows parapsychology publishes significant results only about one-third of the time (32.5%), while three mainstream psychology surveys report positive findings in roughly two-thirds to over 95% of published studies. This contrast suggests parapsychology is comparatively open to null outcomes, making it unlikely that a cache of unpublished negative ESP experiments could overturn its meta-analytic conclusions. Mainstream psychologyâ€™s consistently high positive rates point to stronger publication bias and underscore the value of preregistration and dedicated null-result outlets across disciplines. Overall, concerns about hidden nulls in parapsychology should shift toward strengthening methodological rigor rather than suspecting unseen negative evidence.",
