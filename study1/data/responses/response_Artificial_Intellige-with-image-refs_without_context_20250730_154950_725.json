  "output_text": "The chart illustrates a continuous feedback loop that starts by combining CRM records with AI-driven intent signals to pinpoint the highest-value accounts. Those prioritized targets are fed into ad platforms, where engagement data is captured and passed along to the sales team for personalized outreach. As sales interactions unfold, performance metrics are analyzed and recycled back into the CRM, sharpening both account scoring and ad targeting over time. This cycle ensures marketing and sales stay tightly aligned, focusing resources where theyâ€™re most likely to convert. By constantly learning from each stage, the process drives steadily improving engagement rates and maximizes overall ROI.",
