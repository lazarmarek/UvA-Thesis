  "output_text": "The chart tracks English and Spanish total scores across baseline, intervention, and maintenance for three participants. Initially, two participants scored higher in Spanish than English while one showed stronger English performance, but all three experienced notable increases in English scores during the intervention phase. Spanish scores also improved or stabilized for participants across the same period, and both language gains persisted into the maintenance phase. This pattern indicates the bilingual intervention effectively boosted weaker language skills and reinforced stronger ones, leading to balanced improvement. These durable gains suggest that integrating targeted bilingual strategies can sustainably enhance proficiency in both languages.",
