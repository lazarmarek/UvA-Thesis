  "output_text": "The chart shows that across sighted people, congenitally blind people, and GPT-4, artifacts intended to be colorful are consistently judged to have more colors than those not intended to be colorful. Sighted and blind participants exhibit nearly identical increases in color counts for “colorfulness-intent” items, demonstrating that people born without vision use an object’s intended function to infer how many colors it likely has. GPT-4 also assigns more colors to those intent-driven items, but with a somewhat smaller overall effect, indicating that language alone can capture some—but not all—of the human pattern. These results reveal that intention-based reasoning, rather than direct sensory experience, plays a key role in predicting an object’s appearance.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
