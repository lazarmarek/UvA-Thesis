  "output_text": "The chart shows that today’s pure electric-vehicle drivers begin to feel uneasy as soon as their state of charge falls below 50%, with almost 60 % reporting discomfort at that point, while plug-in hybrid owners are somewhat less worried (about 47 %). In contrast, drivers in earlier studies—both battery-electric and conventional gasoline cars—only reported anxiety much closer to an empty tank or battery, with fewer than 5 % uncomfortable at the 50 % mark. Both modern EV and PHEV users also show noticeable concern once charge drops below 25 %, whereas legacy drivers mainly react when warned of an “almost empty” battery or tank. This pattern highlights that current EV adopters exhibit significant mid-range “range anxiety,” suggesting that improving public charging infrastructure and clearer charge-level information could help ease their concerns.",
