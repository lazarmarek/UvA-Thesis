  "output_text": "The diagram outlines a multi-stage AI workflow that first sanitizes user inputs by stripping out emojis and extraneous expressions before they ever reach the core model. It then feeds the cleaned prompt into a specialized coding engine, enriched with context through retrieval-augmented generation to boost relevance and accuracy. A secondary “trimmer” model inspects the raw output for any hidden exploits or policy breaches, pruning away problematic snippets. A final set of automated checks enforces compliance and quality criteria before the answer reaches the user. This layered approach shows how combining input/output hygiene with domain-tuned models and safeguards can meaningfully reduce errors and security risks in automated code assistants.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
