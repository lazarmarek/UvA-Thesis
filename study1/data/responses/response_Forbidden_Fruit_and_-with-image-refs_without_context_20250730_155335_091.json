  "output_text": "The chart illustrates how harsh bans can make an item more attractive, turning symbolic appeal into an underlying craving that leads to first use. When those bans lift, sudden freedom triggers an opportunity shock that, combined with stress and coping challenges, strengthens the habit and drives it toward compulsive overuse. This two-phase model shows that prohibition alone may backfire if people lack practical tools for managing stress. Introducing moderate restrictions alongside coping support and gradual exposure can prevent initial curiosity from spiraling into harmful addiction.",
