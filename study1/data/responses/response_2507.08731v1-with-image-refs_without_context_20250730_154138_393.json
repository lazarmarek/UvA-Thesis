  "output_text": "The chart shows that Type IIb supernovae exhibit much stronger helium absorption and broader spectral lines than Type II explosions during the first 40 days after the blast, reflecting their helium-rich outer layers and faster-expanding gas. Regular Type II events remain clustered at low helium strength and narrower lines, consistent with their hydrogen-dominated envelopes. The small sample of 87A-like explosions falls in between, showing moderate helium and hydrogen line properties. The color gradient from red (earliest) to green (around 40 days) reveals that both helium and hydrogen features steadily grow in strength and width over the first month before leveling off. This clear separation in helium behavior offers a straightforward spectroscopic way to distinguish supernova types early on.",
