  "output_text": "The chart illustrates a rigorous workflow for extracting meaningful outcomes from semi-structured interviews with project participants. Three interview stages—open questioning, framework introduction, and alignment discussions—generate verbatim quotes that feed into an inductive coding phase, creating 140 initial codes. A targeted deductive pass then refines these into 27 detailed codes and, after inter-rater reliability checks, a streamlined codebook of ten core outcomes, with numerical scores deliberately set aside to emphasize qualitative depth. Iterative transcript reviews and supportive literature research underpin these ten themes, ensuring they accurately reflect participant experiences before shaping the study’s conclusions.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
