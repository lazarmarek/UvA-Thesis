  "output_text": "The chart outlines a step-by-step journey from interview recordings to a concise set of research findings. Interviews start with open questions to let participants describe outcomes freely, then introduce a guiding framework to confirm and align those insights, deliberately setting aside numerical scores. Transcripts are reviewed to identify patterns and generate an initial wide range of codes, which are then refined through a structured review and team reliability checks into a smaller set of main and sub-themes. This process is repeated until ten core themes remain in a final codebook, ensuring each theme is both rooted in participant words and consistent across reviewers. Finally, a targeted literature review helps situate these key outcomes within existing knowledge, linking real experiences to broader frameworks.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
