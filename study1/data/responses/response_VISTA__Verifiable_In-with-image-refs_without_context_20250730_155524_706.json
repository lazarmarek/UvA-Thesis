  "output_text": "The chart maps a streamlined, multi-layered pipeline that vets each user request through identity verification, secure AI execution, ethical policy checks, public auditing, and legacy system updates before returning a response. Only authenticated users trigger agents running inside a secure enclave, and every action must pass a policy compliance check or be escalated for human review. Approved actions are immutably recorded on a public ledger to ensure transparency and auditability, while failed verifications or unapproved requests automatically halt the process. This design minimizes security and compliance risks by embedding stops and human interventions at every critical checkpoint.",
