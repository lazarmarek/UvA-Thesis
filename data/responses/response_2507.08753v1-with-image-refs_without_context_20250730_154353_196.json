  "output_text": "The chart compares how four theoretical approaches predict the intensity of neutrinos across a wide energy range. The simplest scenario (red line) remains far below the others, implying that relying on traditional mechanisms would miss most of the potential signal. In contrast, the more detailed models (green, blue, and orange curves) forecast substantially stronger fluxes, with the orange prediction staying highest at the very top of the spectrum. This suggests that detectors optimized for energies around 100 TeV to 1 PeV have the best chance to catch these elusive particles. Focusing experimental sensitivity where these models diverge will provide the most decisive test of competing theories.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\").
