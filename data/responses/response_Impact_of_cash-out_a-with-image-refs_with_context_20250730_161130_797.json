  "output_text": "The chart compares how risky bets are—measured by the implied probability of winning—for low- and high-PGSI participants when a cash-out option is either unavailable or available. In both subgroups, the medians and spreads of bet riskiness overlap almost completely regardless of cash-out availability, and statistical tests confirm no significant differences (p = 0.18 for low-PGSI; p = 0.55 for high-PGSI). This indicates that offering bettors the chance to lock in a partial return does not meaningfully change how conservatively or aggressively they wager. In practical terms, adding a cash-out feature appears neutral in its impact on the inherent risk level of bets, even among those at higher risk of gambling harm.",
