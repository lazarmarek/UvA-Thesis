  "output_text": "The chart reveals that personal religious conviction and the social or practical aspects of faith shape environmental values in different ways, which then influence green buying choices. Deeply held beliefs boost both self-focused and altruistic motivations for protecting nature, while socially driven religious practice mainly fuels self-focused reasons for caring about the environment. Both types of environmental concern—whether aimed at personal well-being or the welfare of others—lead to stronger intentions to purchase eco-friendly products. This suggests that messages appealing to moral duty or communal benefit can be especially effective at encouraging sustainable consumer behavior.",
