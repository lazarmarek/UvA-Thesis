  "output_text": "The chart compares four text-generation models on two fronts: how closely they match the exact wording of a reference (ROUGE-L) and how well they capture its meaning (BERTScore). JusticeNetBD clearly outperforms the others, roughly doubling their ROUGE-L scores (about 0.46 versus 0.21–0.24) while also leading in semantic similarity (around 0.90 versus 0.85–0.86). DeepSeek V3, Gemini 2.5 Flash and ChatGPT 4o Turbo form a tight cluster with moderate semantic fidelity but low lexical overlap, suggesting they grasp meaning but struggle to reproduce phrasing. This contrast reveals a common trade-off between capturing nuance and preserving exact wording. Teams seeking both precise wording and deep semantic alignment should investigate the techniques behind JusticeNetBD’s balanced performance.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
