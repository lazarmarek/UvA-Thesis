  "output_text": "The chart compares two typical weekday energy profiles—one household empty during the day and one with someone at home—under the current late-afternoon peak window and a proposed shift to 4–10 pm. Moving the peak period later means that out-of-home families would see a large chunk of their dinner-time cooking and laundry load hit the high-rate hours, so their bills could climb unless they run major appliances before 4 pm. Stay-at-home households already concentrate much of their usage in the morning and early afternoon, so they avoid most of the extra peak exposure but still incur heavy evening demand in the new window. In both cases, scheduling dishwashers, washing machines or cooking tasks before 4 pm or after 10 pm offers a clear way to reduce peak-period charges.",
