  "output_text": "The chart highlights a pronounced bias in local reporting towards a few core places, with Neuch√¢tel dominating location mentions, followed by the canton of Valais, Switzerland at large, and La Chaux-de-Fonds. Beyond these top four, attention falls off sharply through towns like Sion, Martigny and Lausanne, confirming that local news frames its stories around immediately familiar communities. This tight clustering of coverage reinforces how proximity drives not just geographic focus but also a shared local identity. For media planners and civic leaders, these insights suggest prioritizing content and engagement efforts in these key hotspots while also seeking ways to bring smaller municipalities into the spotlight.",
