  "output_text": "The chart shows that as drivers’ eye-movement transitions become more erratic, their risk of collision during a critical takeover climbs steadily—moving from a less random to an average level predicts about a 7-percentage-point increase, and risk accelerates even faster at higher levels. The shaded band indicates growing uncertainty around predictions at extreme levels of randomness. Other gaze patterns and pupil size (mental workload) are held steady at typical levels to isolate this effect. In practical terms, systems that track the unpredictability of gaze transitions could flag when a driver’s collision risk is rising. Timely alerts or assistance triggered by spikes in eye-movement randomness could help prevent accidents during critical control transfers.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
