  "output_text": "The chart shows that teachers’ homework assignments boost students’ homework engagement, which then builds their underlying math ability. That math ability drives performance on each of five test questions, but there’s also a direct influence from students’ homework engagement to each question—revealing potential bias in those item scores. The linked error terms between homework engagement and math ability suggest other common factors at play. Overall, this structure highlights the importance of accounting for students’ homework habits when interpreting test results to ensure scores truly reflect math skill rather than extra homework effects.",
