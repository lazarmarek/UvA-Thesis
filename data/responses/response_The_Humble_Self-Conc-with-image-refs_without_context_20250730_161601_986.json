  "output_text": "The chart outlines a moral framework built on three pillars—recognizing human limits, treating like cases alike, and committing to an imperfect but persistent effort to do good—that together prioritize harm mitigation and long-term well-being. By rejecting conditional worth and extrinsic rewards, it shows how empathy and intrinsic motivation create a virtuous cycle of resilience and truth-seeking. This cycle feeds back into ever-stronger harm reduction and personal growth, leading to the hypothesis that every individual possesses unconditional worth. The framework’s actionable insight is clear: policies, cultures, and personal habits should emphasize fair treatment, intrinsic values, and ongoing virtuous effort to cultivate self-compassion, steady self-esteem, and humility as practical imperatives.",
