  "output_text": "The diagram illustrates how all access requests—whether initiated by people, devices, or applications—are routed into a unified verification system. It shows three layers of checks—rule-based policies, user roles (for example “manager” or “guest”), and contextual attributes (such as time of day or device security status)—working together to determine whether to allow, deny, or prompt for additional authentication. Approved requests then flow to the appropriate resources—data, services, applications, or hardware—while ineligible attempts are blocked or stepped-up. Underpinning the entire process is continuous visibility and analytics, giving security teams real-time insights into every access event. By combining multiple decision layers with ongoing monitoring, this approach adapts to changing conditions and keeps critical assets protected without unnecessary friction.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
