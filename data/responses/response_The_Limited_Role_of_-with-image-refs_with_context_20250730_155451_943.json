  "output_text": "The chart shows that when participants simply played the prediction task (baseline), their average score hovered right around the six-correct mark you’d expect by chance, with only a slight uptick suggesting minimal dishonesty. Once the game was set up so they could cheat after paying, however, the entire distribution of reported scores shifted dramatically to the right, with a large spike at the maximum of twelve correct predictions and mean scores climbing above ten. This pattern grew stronger in later rounds—when stakes were higher, up to 85.8% of participants likely reported inflated scores. The data make it clear that introducing a cost to play while still allowing post-payment cheating greatly amplifies dishonest behavior. To curb this, designers should reconsider how financial incentives and reporting transparency interact in decision-making tasks.",
