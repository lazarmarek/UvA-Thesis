  "output_text": "The chart shows that students scoring below the passing cutoff of 80 continue to retake the test at high rates—roughly 75% to 90%—while those hitting or exceeding the threshold see repeat rates plunge to around 25% and 10%. This consistent behavior among all failing‐score groups indicates a uniform drive to improve regardless of how low the initial grade was. To curb the volume of retakes, schools might concentrate remedial resources on learners just below the pass mark where extra support can quickly translate to fewer repeats. Conversely, offering advanced modules or enrichment opportunities for students who pass could sustain engagement and encourage ongoing skill development.",
