  "output_text": "The chart shows a two-step AI pipeline where a cleaned-up user prompt first goes to a specialized coding model that draws on course materials to generate tailored responses. A second, independent model then reviews and trims any dubious or manipulated content, blocking adversarial inputs from slipping through. By keeping the reasoning model and the validation model separate, the system ensures that harmful prompts canâ€™t compromise both content creation and safety checks at once. This workflow also combines targeted data retrieval with automated trimming of inputs and outputs to maintain clarity and alignment with educational objectives. The result is reliable, high-quality feedback that prevents inappropriate or off-topic material from reaching learners.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
