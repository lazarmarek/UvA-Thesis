  "output_text": "The chart shows that about two-thirds of participants believe their posts were removed “to silence my opinion.” A smaller group attributed takedowns to having “violated community standards” (12) or being removed “for political reasons” (11). Very few cited platform bias, language barriers, or other causes, suggesting most see moderation as active suppression rather than a mistake or rule enforcement. This widespread view highlights a deep distrust in platform policies among Tamil creators. Platforms could address this by offering clear, localized explanations and transparent appeal processes whenever content is restricted.",
