  "output_text": "The chart demonstrates that by combining a normalized hall-effect sensor signal of hand aperture with its time derivative, it is possible to automatically and accurately segment a pick-and-place action into five distinct phases: reach, grasp, transport, release and button reach. During reach, the hand remains fully open (signal plateau at 1) before a rapid negative velocity peak marks the onset of grasp, followed by a stable closed state in transport and a positive velocity peak indicating release. Applying fixed velocity thresholds (±0.025) consistently identifies these transitions without manual intervention, ensuring precise temporal alignment across trials. This robust phase detection underpins reliable statistical comparisons of stimulation versus non-stimulation conditions and could readily be adapted in other sensor-driven movement analyses to improve reproducibility and reduce labeling bias.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
