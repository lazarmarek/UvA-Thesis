  "output_text": "The chart shows that embedding inclusive excellence in a department hinges on three linked practices—aligning ideals and policies, raising awareness of cultural dynamics, and analyzing the conditions for change. Each practice brings clear benefits (promises) like stronger accountability, a richer cultural climate, and measurable progress, alongside risks such as burnout, unconscious biases, and resistance to power shifts. By proactively addressing these threats—through policy reconciliation, targeted training, and transparent evaluation—departments can cultivate equity-driven norms, affirm diverse perspectives, and sustain transformational change. Ultimately, this integrated approach guides leaders to build accountable, inclusive cultures that respect variation and maintain momentum toward justice.",
