  "output_text": "The chart reveals that most EV drivers start to feel uneasy once battery levels drop to around 50%, with 57.9% of EV and 46.8% of PHEV owners reporting discomfort at this point. Only about 5% in both groups wait for a warning light or an almost empty battery, and just over 20% tolerate levels below 25%, indicating a proactive approach to charging well before critically low states. Compared with data from 2018, todayâ€™s electric vehicle users show even greater sensitivity at mid-level charges than earlier battery-electric and conventional car drivers. This suggests that public charging networks and onboard reminders should focus on supporting drivers when batteries are still half full to maintain confidence and avoid last-minute charging surges.",
