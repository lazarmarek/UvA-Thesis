  "output_text": "The chart lays out how prioritizing harm reduction and long-term well-being gives rise to a theory of unconditional human worth. It starts from two core ethical considerations—respecting people’s real capacities and ensuring fair, equal treatment—and then rejects any system that ties worth to performance. By highlighting everyone’s ongoing, imperfect efforts as inherently valuable, it shows how resilience fuels honest reflection and lowers shame. These insights converge into the practical conclusion that steady self-compassion, grounded in intrinsic worth, forms a foundation for durable well-being. Adopting simple daily reminders of inherent value can break cycles of self-criticism and build sustainable inner strength.",
