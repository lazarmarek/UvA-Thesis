  "output_text": "The chart depicts a hierarchical model where a single dependency factor underlies three linked patterns of AI use: persistent preoccupation with using AI, real-life negative consequences, and withdrawal symptoms when access is blocked. Each pattern loads very strongly onto overall dependency (.93, .91, and .96 respectively), confirming they are all central components of AI reliance. Item‐level loadings range from .60 to .89, showing that every question in the scale meaningfully measures its intended issue. The especially high link to withdrawal symptoms suggests that emotional distress (restlessness, irritability, distraction) when AI access is cut off is the clearest sign of problematic dependence. These results validate the scale’s robustness and point to withdrawal indicators as key early warning signs for identifying excessive AI reliance.",
