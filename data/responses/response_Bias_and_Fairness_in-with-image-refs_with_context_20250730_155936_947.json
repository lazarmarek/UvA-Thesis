  "output_text": "The visualization breaks medical language models into three configuration choices—task specialization (general vs. domain-specific), deployment style (external vs. in-house), and transparency level (open vs. closed)—and pairs these with four ethical pillars: bias and fairness, explainability, infrastructure, and transparency. Each pillar is linked to concrete actions such as measuring outcome parity, providing clear AI justifications, involving clinicians and engineers collaboratively, and safeguarding patient privacy with regulatory compliance. This alignment shows that selecting the right model type must go hand in hand with bias detection, fairness metrics, and clear records of decision logic to protect underrepresented patient groups. Embedding legal requirements and clinical expertise into the technical infrastructure ensures accuracy and respects consent and data protection laws. Together, these elements form a practical roadmap for healthcare teams to deploy AI responsibly, monitor equitable outcomes, and maintain trust throughout the development process.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
