  "output_text": "The diagram presents a four-step pipeline for converting informal math problems into trustworthy formal examples by combining data creation, direct translation, automated checking, and expert validation. It begins by gathering and expanding a language corpus with relevant concepts, then uses a trained model to turn each problem into a precise “knowledge equation.” Next, automated syntax checks weed out formatting errors before deeper semantic reviews by AI tools and human experts catch logical inconsistencies. Only entries passing all checks are added to the dataset, feeding back into training to steadily improve translation accuracy. This multi-layered process overcomes the lack of clean data and ensures the final models learn from rigorously vetted examples.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
