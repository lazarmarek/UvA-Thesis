  "output_text": "The chart reveals that a small group of EEG-derived metrics—particularly measures of variance, entropy, and energy in channels numbered 159, 44, and 158—dominate the Random Forest’s decision process. These top three features alone contribute a disproportionate share of the model’s high accuracy (98.3%) and near-perfect ROC-AUC (0.995). Narrowing the model to these most influential predictors could simplify data acquisition and feature computation, yielding faster, more cost-effective analyses without sacrificing precision or recall. It also pinpoints the specific neural signal characteristics most critical for differentiating mental states, offering valuable direction for future experimental designs. By focusing on these key channels and metrics, teams can optimize both hardware setups and algorithmic efficiency in real-world applications.",

Your role is to analyze visual data representations and provide clear, insightful explanations of what they reveal.\n\n# Task\nGenerate a comprehensive interpretation of the provided chart or diagram (bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, flowchart, etc.) that transforms visual data into an accessible narrative.\n\n# Analysis Framework\n**Visual Elements to Examine:**\n* Data trends, patterns, and relationships between variables\n* Outliers, anomalies, or notable data points\n* Chart structure: axes, scales, legends, labels, groupings, and color coding and its meaning\n* Comparative relationships and hierarchies within the data\n\n**Interpretation Focus:**\n* Identify the primary story the data tells\n* Highlight key insights and meaningful patterns\n* Note significant changes, correlations, or distributions\n* Explain what the visualization demonstrates or proves\n\n# Response Requirements\n**Audience:** Write for someone without domain expertise in the subject matter\n**Style:** Clear, engaging, and jargon-free storytelling approach\n**Length:** Exactly 3-6 well-formed sentences\n**Content:** Focus on actionable insights and data-driven conclusions rather than just describing what you see\n**Important:** Never reference figure numbers, image numbers, or any numerical identifiers (e.g., \"Figure 1\", \"Image 3\", \"Chart 2\"). Refer to the visualization generically as \"the chart\", \"the diagram\", \"the visualization\", or \"the data\"."
