  "output_text": "The chart shows that the strength and width of the hydrogen and helium lines form a continuous spread rather than two separate clusters, with SNe IIb generally displaying stronger and broader features and SNe II showing weaker, narrower lines. A band of overlap around moderate values highlights how these two types become harder to distinguish outside a specific time window. Indeed, the clearest separation appears about 10 to 20 days after the explosion, while measurements taken very early or later tend to blend together. A few rare 87A-like events stand out with exceptionally strong hydrogen absorption, underscoring their unique behaviour despite their low numbers. Overall, this implies that timing is crucial: using these line measurements to classify supernovae is most reliable in that early sweet spot before their spectra converge.",
